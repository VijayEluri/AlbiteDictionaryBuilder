**Albite Dictionary Builder**

AlbDict.jar dictionary.xml *[wordlist.txt]*

* dictionary.xml is the dictionary itself
* wordlist.txt is used if you'd like to include only some words

*Note that both files must be in UTF-8. See the readme for more info.*

One can test a builded dictionary for errors, too:

AlbDict.jar dictionary.ald

A built dictionary is distinguished by the app by its extension: **.ald**
